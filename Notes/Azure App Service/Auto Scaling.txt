Azure App Service:

Auto scaling:

	1.	Scaling is the ability to quickly and easily increase or decrease the computation power of an IT solution or resource.

	2.	Increase of load i.e., varying incoming HTTP requests, on the web applications can be handled  
		with the help of auto scaling by ensuring other instances of VM's are made available 
		so that load gets distributed across.

	3.	The scale settings take only seconds to apply and affect all the apps in your App Service Plan.
	
	4.	No code change or redeployment is required for your application.

	5.	Basic app service plan provides scaling of up to 3 VM's manually.

	6.	Standard or higher app service plans will have auto scaling feature.

	7.	Scaling Out and Scaling In of infrastructure will be automatically triggered based on conditions or metric Ex: CPU percentage of the VM's.
	
	8.	The billing or cost of the app service plan depends on the number of compute machines that run in the background to support load on the web site.

Scaling Up/Vertical scaling: 

	Adding more resources like CPU, Memory and disk to increase more compute power and storage capacity on the VM's.

Scaling Out/Horizontal scaling: 
	
	Increase the number of VM instances that run your app.

Scaling In: 

	Decrease the number of VM instances that run your app.

Q: What is the difference between Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling?

	Scaling up is adding further resources, like hard drives and memory to increase the computing capacity of physical servers where as 
	scaling out is adding more servers to spread the workload across more machines.

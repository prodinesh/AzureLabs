Azure Container Groups:

	-	A container group is collection of containers that get scheduled on same host machine.
	-	The containers in a container group share a lifecycle, resources, local network, 
		and storage volumes.
	- 	It's similar concept to a pod in Kubernetes.
	- 	Multi-container groups currently support only Linux containers.
	- 	For Windows containers, Azure Container Instances only supports deployment 
		of a single container instance.

Common scenarios:

	Multiple-container groups are useful in cases where you want to divide a single
	functional task into a small number of container images.
	These images can then be delivered by different teams and having seperate resource 
	requirements.
	
Examples/usecases:
	
	1.	A container serving a web application and a container pulling the latest content
		from source control.
	2.	An application container and a logging container.
		The logging conatiner collects the logs and metrics output by the main
		application and writes them to long-term storage.
	3.	An application container and a monitoring container.
		The monitoring container periodically makes a request to the application
		to ensure that it's running and responding correctly and raises an alert
		if it's not.
	4.	A front-end container and a back-end container. The front end might serve
		a web application, with the back end running a service to retrieve data.
